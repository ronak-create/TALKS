  <h3>1. What Are Cookies?</h3>
  <p>
    Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer,
    smartphone, or tablet) when you visit websites. These files are placed by
    the website you visit to collect information about your browsing behavior,
    preferences, and interactions with the site. Cookies enable websites to
    remember you and your preferences, making it easier for you to navigate and
    interact with the site during future visits. They can enhance the
    functionality of the site and provide a personalized experience based on
    your previous actions.
